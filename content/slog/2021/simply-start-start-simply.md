You have a past and a future, where does one begin again?

- burn it all to the ground, a.k.a. smash your backups delete your hard drive
- open tabs
- 2 new for every one old
- what’s still uncrossed in current sketchbook / notes?
- in expanding circles 🕳🕳🕳 (black hole theory)
- all digital
	- all analog
- the old to-do list
	- writing the new to-do list
- what's in the bookshelves?
- taking stock of it all
- GTD’s “capture everything”
	- the psychic weight of open loops
- one thing, then another
- give up control
	- to people
	- to randomness
- worst things first, I'm the masochist
- MVP: minumum viable product
- <s>just write a list of possibilities for your first blog post</s>
- quit trying to figure it out
